This soft program was built in accodance with what was requested
by HEB Corp. To have built a Histrogram counting the most occuernce
of a word in a given paragraph. 
The output was to be formatted so that the most occured word
is at the top of the list, along with a count and matching '='.
This program can handle more than the given paragraph, with syntax
such as '?', ' " ', ',', '.'  .
